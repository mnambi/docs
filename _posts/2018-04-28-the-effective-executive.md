### The eight practices of effective executives
1. Ask what needs to be done

   The question is not about what the you want to do. It is about what needs to be done for success of the enterprise. There will mostly be more than a few tasks that need to be completed. To be effective limit the number of tasks that you are working on at the same time. Ideally, one would take on one task at a time. A lot of people can juggle two tasks efficiently. Very few can juggle more than two. For me, the sweet spot is at two tasks so that I can utilize time efficiently if one of my tasks is blocked due to dependency on other resources. 

   Once you know what tasks need to be performed, the tasks need to be ordered based on priority. This is a very vital steps and something that requires a little bit of experience. After completing the high priority tasks, reset the priority list, and ask the question again "what must be done now?" Most of the times the task that was the second priority in the previous list will not be as important anymore. Out of the list pick the high priority tasks that you can perform best, and delegate others. 


2. Ask what is right for the enterprise
   
   Determine if the task is going to benefit the enterprise. This should be more important than the benefit of any individual or group of individuals in the enterprise. 
  
3. Develop action plans. 

   Effective executives are doers. Knowledge is not useful till it is converted to action. Before action, they executive needs to answer a number of questions such as: 
    - What are his desired results? 
    - What are his constraints? 
    - How is he going to achieve the results? 
    - What kind of resoures will he require? 
    - What will he do if things don't go according to plan? 

A written plan needs to be flexible to a enticipate changes. It needs a plan for checking the results against the requirements. 

   
4. Take responsibility for actions. 
5. Take responsibility for communicating. 
6. Focus on opportunity rather than problems. 
7. Run productive meetings. 
8. Think 'We' rather than 'I'.






1. Time logging
Effective executives run time logs every 3-4 weeks. This usually shows that they have drifted in use of time. Systematic time management is required. 
1. Identify and eliminate things that need not be done at all. 
2. Learn to 'No' to activities that contribute nothing to one-self or to one's company. 
3.Which of the activities in my time log can be done by somebody else. 
4. Delegation: It does not mean that you push your work to someone else. 
Delegate tasks that can be done by someone else and maybe better. 
5. Do not waste time of other. The effective executive asks others what he does wastes someone else's time. The executive should be ready for the answer. 





Effectiveness means doing the right things well. 

1. Record where your time goes. 
2. Focus on contribution. Be concerned with results. Assume responsibility rather than working as a subordinate
3. Making strengths productive. Both one's own and others strengths. 
4. First things first. This and first point are the twin pillars of effectiveness. Foresight, self-reliance, courage. 
5. The effective decision is concerned rational action.
