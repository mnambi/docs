Graphs can help visualize complex relations and comparison. It is also a double-edged sword; if not used correctly, can result is reducing the impact of your work. In this post, I am focussing on graphs that are premdominantly used for conveying technical data.

- #### Line styles, colors, and markers

I would suggest thinking backwards from the main takeway for the graph. List out what information the listener should know before he can
