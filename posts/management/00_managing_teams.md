1. Share the burden of 24/7 acroos the team
No team member is expected to attend a team meeeting between 10 pm and 7 am. 

2. Schedule meetings to help far-flung people connect

4. Pay extra attention to your colleagues who are on the phone or on video
People present in the room or on video chat might get more preference than people on the phone because of their physical presence. Some ways to break this disparity is to be aware of the team members on phone and actively involving them in conversations. For e.g., stop a passionate conversation and ask them to chime in. 

5. Invest in bringing the team together on a regular rhythm to foster team cohesion
No tool can replace being together in the same room. Organize regular meets (twice a year or more) for renewing personal ties, building trust, and having unmediated experiences together. Author's three rules for the meeting: 
--We should build something together
--We should learn something together
--We should have plenty of informal, social time

''All of these different approaches add up to increasing our team’s empathy for one another.   This compassion fuels trust, engagement, and collaboration – and drives our business forward.''
