I am roboticist with experience in surgical robotics, robotic-manipulationand medical devices. My journey in robotics started with building an RC car (because my parents did not want to buy me one). I received my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering where I built a cool surgical robot for eye surgery. Currently, I am working as a software engineer for Amazon Robotics in North Reading building their next generation robotic system for warehouses.
